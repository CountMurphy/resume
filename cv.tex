\section{About}

With 15 years of experience in the software engineering and
computer security fields, I have successfully designed, implemented,
maintained and delivered many successful projects in a wide variety of
roles with a very broad spectrum of subject matter.

Security is a primary focus because it affords me an opportunity
to learn about new things and keep my focus fresh. All software needs
a level of security, and using that as an entry point, there will
always be a new and interesting corner of computing for me to explore.

\section{Highlighted Projects}

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
      {2014-2015}
      {Designed secure embedded operating system}
      {Inverse Limit (for Google)}
      {
        As part of Google ATAP's \emph{Project Vault}, Inverse Limit's small team of 4 designed and developed a complete computer platform with a security focus. All components are open source; the board schematics, OS, applications, drivers, toolchain, emulator, and even the CPU (based on OpenRISC) have been released to GitHub. Among other things, I was solely responsible for implementing the real-time multitasking operating system for the project.\\
%        
%        Earlier in the project I was responsible for creating the initial software that used a fake FAT filesystem as a means of socket communication between an external device and an Android device without need for a kernel driver.\\

      }
  \entry
      {2013}
      {Implemented an x86 hypervisor/fuzzer}
      {Inverse Limit (for DARPA)}
      {The MAIM project (Micro-architecture Instruction Mining) was one of three Cyber Fast Track proposals that DARPA accepted from Inverse Limit. It consisted of an x86 instruction fuzzer and a cross-platform hypervisor to execute the instructions and compare their behavior on different implementations. The project identified several undocumented differences between Intel, AMD and VIA architectures.\\

      }
  \entry
      {2010-2011}
      {Delivered a complete TCP/IP Stack}
      {BreakingPoint Systems}
      {I redesigned BreakingPoint's existing network security test framework from a traffic simulator into a fully featured TCP/IP stack that could test live applications. Both were implemented in Ruby, but by integrating concurrency into the design and strategically replacing components with C extensions, the performance was quadrupled.}

\section{Personal Interests}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Music}: I play guitars, bass, drums, synths and recently, a thrash metal ukulele}
\item{\textbf{Home Improvement}: My recently-purchased first house has been keeping me busy}
\item{\textbf{Entertaining}: Inviting friends for smoked meats, craft beers, and fine whisky}
\item{\textbf{Career}: Attending conferences and local meetups to socialize and stay current}
