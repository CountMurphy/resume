\section{overview}

I've got 15 years of experience in the software engineering and
computer security fields, I have successfully designed, implemented,
maintained and delivered many successful projects in a wide variety of
roles with a very broad spectrum of subject matter.

Security is a main focus of mine because it affords me an opportunity
to learn about new things and keep my focus fresh. All software needs
a level of security and, using that as an entry point, there will
always be a new and interesting corner of computing for me to explore.

\section{personal interests}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Music}: I play guitars, bass, drums, synths and recently, a thrash metal ukulele}
\item{\textbf{Home Improvement}: My recently-purchased first house has been keeping me busy}
\item{\textbf{Entertaining}: Inviting friends for some smoked meats, craft
  beers, and fine whisky}
\item{\textbf{Career}: Attending conferences and local meetups to keep current
  and socialize}
\end{itemize}

      {Inverse Limit (for Google)}
      {
        As part of Google's \emph{Project Vault}, Inverse Limit's small team of 4 designed and developed a complete computer platform with a security focus. All components are open source. The board schematics, OS, applications, drivers, toolchain, emulator, and even the CPU (based on OpenRISC) have been released to GitHub. I was solely responsible for implementing the real-time multitasking operating system (among other things) for the project.\\

%        Earlier in the project I was responsible for creating the initial software that used a fake FAT filesystem as a means of socket communication between an external device and an Android device without need for a kernel driver.\\

      {Inverse Limit (for DARPA)}
      {The MAIM project (Micro-architecture Instruction Mining) was one of three Cyber Fast Track proposals that DARPA accepted from Inverse Limit. It consisted of an x86 instruction fuzzer and a cross-platform hypervisor to execute the instructions and compare their behavior on different implementations. The project was able to identify several undocumented differences between Intel, AMD and Via architectures.\\

Both versions were implemented in Ruby, but by deeply integrating concurrency into the new design and strategically replacing Ruby components with C extensions, I also managed to quadruple the performance of the already heavily optimized code.}
