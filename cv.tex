\section{overview}

I've got 15 years of experience in the software engineering and
computer security fields, I have successfully designed, implemented,
maintained and delivered many successful projects in a wide variety of
roles with a very broad spectrum of subject matter.

Security is a main focus of mine because it affords me an opportunity
to learn about new things and keep my focus fresh. All software needs
a level of security and using that as an entry point, there will
always be a new an interesting corner of computing for me to explore.

\section{interests}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Music: I play guitars, bass, drums, synths and recently
  acquired a thrash metal ukulele}
\item{Home Improvement: my recently-purchased first house has been keeping me busy}
\item{Entertaining: Having friends over for some smoked meats, craft
  beers, and fine whisky}
\item{Career: Attending conferences and local meetups to keep current
  and socialize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
      {2014-2015}
      {Wrote an open-source security-focused OS}
      {Inverse Limit (for Google)}
      {
        As part of Google's \em{Project Vault} (launch video from Google I/O 2015: \href{http://goo.gl/5mZrVR}{http://goo.gl/5mZrVR}), Inverse Limit's small team of 4 designed and developed a security-focused computer platform. All components are open source, from the board schematics, OS, applications, and even the CPU (based on OpenRISC.)\\
        
        I was solely responsible for implementing the real-time multitasking operating system for the project (source available at \href{http://goo.gl/0pbsk7}{http://goo.gl/0pbsk7}).\\
        
        Earlier in the project I was responsible for creating the initial software that used a fake FAT filesystem as a means of socket communication between an external device and an Android device without need for a kernel driver.\\

      }
  \entry
      {2013}
      {Implemented a custom x86 hypervisor}
      {Inverse Limit (for DARPA)}
      {The MAIM project (Micro-architecture Instruction Mining) was one of three Cyber Fast Track proposals that DARPA accepted from Inverse Limit. It consisted of an x86 instruction fuzzer and a cross-plaform hypervisor to execute the instructions and compare their behavior on different implementations. The project was able to identify several undocumented differences between Intel, AMD and Via architectures.\\

      }
  \entry
      {2009-2011}
      {Delivered a complete TCP/IP Stack}
      {BreakingPoint Systems}
      {I took BreakingPoint's existing network security testing framework and completely redesigned it from a traffic simulator into a fully featured TCP/IP stack that could communicate and test live applications. Both versions were implemented in Ruby, but by deeply integrating concurrency into the new design and strategically replacing Ruby components with C extensions, I also managed to quadruple the performance of the already heavily optimized code.}
