    With 8 years of experience in the software engineering 
    field as a full stack developer, I have successfully researched, designed, 
    implemented, maintained and delivered many successful
    projects in a wide variety of roles with a broad spectrum of
    subject matter.\\
    
    Security is a primary interest to me because it affords an opportunity to
    constantly learn new and interesting things. Everything needs a
    level of security, and using that as an entry point, there will
    always be broad and ever-expanding aspects of technology to
    explore.\\
    
    \textbf{Skills:}
    \begin{resumeitemize2}
    \item{\textbf{General}: Security, R\&D, Networking, Performance, Embedded}
    \item{\textbf{Languages}: C\#, C, C++ (including QT5 and boost), SQL, JavaScript, Angular, PHP, Python, Shell scripting, Java, \LaTeX, NodeJS}
    \item{\textbf{Architectures}: X86, X86\_64, ARM}
    \item{\textbf{Software}: Linux, Windows, GCC, MariaDB, SQL Server, GDB, KiCad, Vim, Git, Azure, SVN, Mercurial, TFS}

    %\textbf{Personal Interests:}
    %\begin{resumeitemize2}
    %\item{\textbf{Music}: Guitars, bass, drums, brass, synths and recently, a thrash metal ukulele}
    %\item{\textbf{Home Improvement}: My first house has been keeping me busy with plenty of projects}
    %\item{\textbf{Entertaining}: Inviting friends over for smoked meats, craft beers, and fine whisky}
